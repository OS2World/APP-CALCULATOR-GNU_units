Version 1.81

* Fixed missing definition of "au" in units.dat.

Version 1.80

* Rewritten parser supports () for grouping, supports noninteger
  powers of numbers (e.g. 3^0.25), supports a bunch of functions (log,
  ln, log2, sin, cos, tan, exp) which can have units as arguments but
  they must reduce to dimensionless (e.g. log(watts/horsepower)),
  supports sqrt(unit) and cuberoot(unit), higher roots as unit^(1|4).

* functions can be defined in units.dat along with their inverse, and
  conversion to a function by specifying it's name alone as the "want"
  item. 

* tables with linear interpolation

* help command summarizes operations, help unit browses the units
  database at the definition of the specified unit.  Specify "?" for
  the want unit and get a list of all conformable units.  

* Support for locales

* units file extended and corrected
